LH codec (Lernout & Hauspie StreamTalk 80 codec) requires ST80W.dll from the F4 installation folder.  
Speex codec requires libspeex.dll & libspeexdsp.dll.  If you use the Speex codec in your code, you will need to include the Speex license file as a text file in your application's distributables. 
Also, the exact .DLL versions and license file required by the Speex codec functionality can be found in the SpeexInvoke project (parallel to the F4Utils.Speech project, in the Lightning's Tools repository).
